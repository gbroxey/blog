I go by ``griff`` / ``heteroing`` on Project Euler. This is where I'll post some of the math and programming stuff that I'm working on or think is interesting. Any relevant code will be included in the repository for the site, and it will most likely be written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) or [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/).
