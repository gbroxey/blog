I've gathered some problems I haven't been able to completely resolve.  

If you decide to try these, or if you find that they've been solved in literature somewhere, I'd be interested to hear about them. I'll include a bried summary of progress.

> **Problem 1.** Suppose you have two sets $A$ and $B$ of natural numbers.  
> Write $A \perp B$ if the sets $b_1 A \cap b_2 A$ have zero natural density, whenever $b_1, b_2$ are different elements of $B$. In other words, $A$ has nearly disjoint $B$-dilations.  
> Then the upper density of $A$ is at most
> 
$$\overline{\text{d}}(A) \leq \left(\sum \frac{1}{b}\right)^{-1}$$

See the following posts for context: [1](/blog/2023/04/13/density-gcds.html) [2](/blog/2023/04/18/dilations-primes.html)

The first post basically proves it for nice $B$ for which there exist $A$ such that the dilations $bA$ are disjoint and such that $A \times B = \mathbb N$. Erd≈ës and Saffari call these "direct factors".  
This case extends to $B = \mathbb N$ by a limiting argument.

The second post proves it for the case in which $\sum \frac{1}{b} = \infty$ and such that the elements of $B$ are pairwise coprime. This contains the case $B = \mathbb P$ being the set of primes.

I've proved it by a few arguments for the cases (for example)

$$\begin{align*}
B &= \lbrace 1, 2, 3 \rbrace\\
B &= \lbrace 1, 2, 5 \rbrace\\
B &= \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace\\
B &= \lbrace 1, p, q \rbrace \,\, \text{ when } p < q < p^2
\end{align*}$$

The general case, as well as the special case $B = \lbrace 1, p, q \rbrace$, remain open.

> **Problem 2.** Fix a base $b > 1$ and a natural number $x_1$.  
> Let $x_{n+1} = x_n + f(x_n)$ where $f(x)$ is the sum of the base-$b$ digits of $x$.  
> Similarly create the sequence $y_n$ starting from a natural number $y_1$.  
> Then there exists an integer $i$ such that $x_n = y_{n+i}$ for all large $n$ iff $\gcd(x_1, b-1) = \gcd(y_1, b-1)$.  
> In the binary case, there always exists such an integer $i$.

It seems like there's some simple proof that I'm just totally overlooking here.

I have a strategy which works to prove the binary problem for $a_1, b_1 \leq 2^{2^{\ddots}^2}$ for some big number of twos. I'll write about that at some point later. In general I don't have a solution to this yet.
