> **Abstract.** Returning to density, I'll prove that if $A, 2A, 3A$ are disjoint, then $\newcommand{\NN}{\mathbb N}
\newcommand{\PP}{\mathbb P}
\newcommand{\dnat}{\mathrm d}
\newcommand{\dsup}{\overline{\mathrm d}}
\newcommand{\dinf}{\underline{\mathrm d}}
\newcommand{\proofqed}{\quad\quad\quad\square}\dsup(A) \leq 6/11$.  
This proof will extend to a bound for $\{1, p, q\}$ for any $1 < p < q \leq p^2$.

This is the third post in a series on density.  
Read [Density and GCDs][density1] and the [Nearly Disjoint Dilations: Primes][density2] first.

Here is the conjecture we continue to contemplate:

> **Conjecture 1.** Suppose $A \perp B$. Then $\dsup(A) \leq H(B)^{-1}$.  
> When $H(B) = \infty$, the conclusion is $\dsup(A) = 0$.

At this point I'll assume you're familiar with my choice of notation. If you're not, then reference the previous two posts.

## Section Header

This is some [writing][reference].
