I have been doing [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems on and off since about 2015 when I was in [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_in_the_United_States). I went to college for math (no grad school \[yet\]) and now I'm working as a tutor.

Most of my interest tends to be in (analytic) number theory and combinatorics but I can be made to poke at some other things with probably much slower progress.

## My Submissions

I've submitted a handful of problems to Project Euler myself, you can find them here:

[561: Divisor Pairs](https://projecteuler.net/problem=561)  
[580: Squarefree Hilbert numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=580)  
[599: Distinct Colourings of a Rubik's Cube](https://projecteuler.net/problem=599)  
[648: Skipping Squares](https://projecteuler.net/problem=648)  
[670: Colouring a Strip](https://projecteuler.net/problem=670) and [671: Colouring a Loop](https://projecteuler.net/problem=671)[^1]  
[821: 123-Separable](https://projecteuler.net/problem=821)  

[^1]: Problem 671 is an extension to 670 created by the PE development team.
