I have been doing [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems on and off since about 2015 when I was in [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_in_the_United_States). I went to college for math (no grad school \[yet\]) and now I'm working as a tutor.

Most of my interest tends to be in (analytic) number theory and combinatorics but I can be made to poke at some other things with probably much slower progress.

When I started in 2015 I worked in Java mostly, but I've been having a lot of fun in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) more recently. I've used [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) throughout. Nim is free if you want to try it, and I think WL should have a free environment outside of their (expensive but helpful) program Mathematica.

## My Submissions

I've submitted a handful of problems to Project Euler myself, you can find them here:

[561: Divisor Pairs](https://projecteuler.net/problem=561)  
[580: Squarefree Hilbert numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=580)  
[599: Distinct Colourings of a Rubik's Cube](https://projecteuler.net/problem=599)  
[648: Skipping Squares](https://projecteuler.net/problem=648)  
[670: Colouring a Strip](https://projecteuler.net/problem=670) and [671: Colouring a Loop](https://projecteuler.net/problem=671)[^1]  
[821: 123-Separable](https://projecteuler.net/problem=821)

## Other Involvements

I made the Facebook group [actually good math problems](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1923323131245618), which is a very decent place to share and work on actually good math problems.
