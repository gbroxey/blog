title: "Calculating (1/2)! by Lattice Point Counting"
---

> **Abstract.** Here $(1/2)!$ is defined as $\Gamma(3/2)$ as usual.  
> The strategy will be to relate $\Gamma$ values to certain power series asymptotics, and applying this to a nicely chosen power series which we can relate to lattice points inside a circle. Then the value of $(1/2)!$ will come from the area of a quarter unit circle. This works to prove the Gamma reflection formula but not as nicely.
