Here's another small test.

Here's some LaTeX: we have $$1+2=3$$.

Also, we have

$$\sum_{i = 1}^{100} i = \frac{100(101)}{2} = 5050$$

Here's the solution to Project Euler 001:

```nim
proc euler1(limit: int): int =
  result = 0
  for i in 0..<limit:
    if (i mod 3 == 0) or (i mod 5 == 0):
      result += i
  
echo euler1(1000)
```
